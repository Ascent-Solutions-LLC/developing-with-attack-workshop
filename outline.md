# Outline for Developing with ATT&CK Workshop

* Mental models needed to interact with ATT&CK STIXX data
* STIXX objects
  * Data Sources
  * Mitigations
  * Groups
  * Techniques
  * Software

Gotchas:

* ATT&CK does Group Navigator layers with TTPs __only__ not the Software that they have also used
* Enumerating STIX data can be costly, caching considerations


Nod to MITRE ATT&CK Defender course....although it covers more of the theory than the practical that our course will discuss.
